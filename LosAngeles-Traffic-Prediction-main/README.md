# LosAngeles-Traffic-Prediction
Los Angeles Traffic Prediction Model using Machine Learning. This project leverages Random Forest and Support Vector Regression algorithms to forecast traffic congestion in Los Angeles based on historical data, weather conditions, and special events. 
#  Project Description
This project analyzes and visualizes traffic data in Los Angeles, with a focus on identifying patterns, correlations, and anomalies. The analysis includes advanced techniques such as clustering and logistic regression, along with interactive maps to help in smart traffic management.
# Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Advanced Analysis: Clustering, Correlation, and Anomaly Detection
Interactive and Static Visualizations
Comprehensive Documentation

# Installation
