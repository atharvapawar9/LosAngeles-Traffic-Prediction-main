# LosAngeles-Traffic-Prediction
Los Angeles Traffic Prediction Model using Machine Learning. This project leverages Random Forest and Support Vector Regression algorithms to forecast traffic congestion in Los Angeles based on historical data, weather conditions, and special events. 
#  Project Description
This project analyzes and visualizes traffic data in Los Angeles, with a focus on identifying patterns, correlations, and anomalies. The analysis includes advanced techniques such as clustering and logistic regression, along with interactive maps to help in smart traffic management.
# Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Advanced Analysis: Clustering, Correlation, and Anomaly Detection
Interactive and Static Visualizations
Comprehensive Documentation

# Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

# Deployment
The project can be deployed by downloading and running the provided html file.

- Steps:
Download html file from the repository.
Open the file in a web browser to view the traffic predictions.
# Note: The traffic_map.html file works optimally on high-performance machines due to its interactive and resource-intensive visualization features.

# Results
The analysis revealed significant traffic congestion in certain areas of Los Angeles, particularly during peak hours. Clustering analysis identified key intersections with high incident rates. The visualizations provide clear insights into the traffic patterns.
